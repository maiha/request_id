RequestId
=========

Rails plugin that adds a new method (Controller#request_id) to distinguish requests


Methods
=======

* ActionController::Base#request_id

  => "3000:1"   # request_id_with_port is true
  => "1"        # request_id_with_port is false


Configurations
==============

* ActionController::Base.request_id_with_port

  Indicates whether request_id needs port number or not.
  It is useful under clustered servers. This is true, by default.


Log
===

* Request ID field is automatically added into log file

Processing UserController#index (for 127.0.0.1 at 2008-11-16 21:30:00) [GET]
  Request ID: 3000:1

Processing UserController#index (for 127.0.0.1 at 2008-11-16 21:30:05) [GET]
  Request ID: 3000:2


Note
====

* request_id is reset when the server restarts

* backend_port is used as port number only on Mongrel server, otherwise frontend_port is used.
  Anyone know how to detect backend port number on Lighttpd, WEBrick and Thin?
